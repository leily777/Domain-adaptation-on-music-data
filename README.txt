My Domain-adapatation project using Tensorflow on Music data (data not provided here)

txtgenerate.py : To generate batch of training image-patchs selected randomly from the training image. There is no class-imbalance. Don't run this file since it's main method with create a train/test dataset for you.
alexnet1,finetun1: To train on Einstein dataset, minimizing just the label classifier loss. 
alexnet1,finetune3 : To train using domain adaptation, taking into account both label and domain loss.
alexnet4,finetun4 : To verify that the gradient_flip() function works at the feature extrator layer.
datagenerator.py : Helper file, to load the image-patchs generated by 'txtgenerate.py' into batchs during training (refer to: https://github.com/kratzert/finetune_alexnet_with_tensorflow)
